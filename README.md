# Xoshiro256PlusSIMD
Serial and SIMD implementation of the Xoshiro256+ random number generator.

This project provides a C++ implementation of Xoshiro256+ that matches the performance of the reference C
implementation of David Blackman and Sebastiano Vigna.  Xoshiro256+ combines high speed, small memory
space requirements for stored state and excellent statistical quality.  For cryptographic use cases or
use cases where absolutely the best statistical quality is required - maybe consider a different RNG like
the Mersenne Twist.  For any just about any conventional simulation or testing use case, Xoshiro256+ should be perfectly fine statistically.

This implementation is a header-only library and provides the following capabilities:

    Single 64 bit unsigned random value
    Single 64 bit unsigned random value reduced to a [lower, upper) range
    Four 64 bit unsigned random values
    Four 64 bit unsigned random values reduced to a [lower, upper) range

    Single double length real random value in a range of (0,1)
    Single double length real random value in a (lower, upper) range
    Four double length real random values in a range of (0,1)
    Four double length real random values in a (lower, upper) range

For platforms supporting the AVX2 instruction set, the RNG can be configured to use AVX2 instructions or not on
an instance by instance basis.  AVX2 instructions are only used for the four-wide operations, there is no advantage
using them for single value generation.

The four-wide operations use a different random seed per value and the the seed for single value generation is
distinct as well.  The same stream of values will be returned by the serial and AVX2 implementations.  It *might*
be faster for the serial implementation to use only a single seed across all the four values - each increasing index
being the next value in a single series, instead of each of the four values having its unique series.  The downside
of that approach is that the serial implementation would return different four wide values than the AVX2 implementation.  
The AVX2 implementation must use distinct seeds for each of the four values.

The random series for each of the four-wide values are separated by 2^192 values - i.e. a Xoshiro256+ 'long jump'
separates the seed for each of the four values.  For clarity, the Xoshiro256+ has a state space of 2^256.

The reduction of the uint64s to an integer range takes uint32 bounds.  This is s significant reduction in the size 
of the random values but permits reduction while avoiding taking a modulus.  If you have a need for random
integer values beyond uint32 sizes, I'd suggest taking the full 64 bit values and applying your own reduction
algorithm.  The modulus approach to reduction is slower than the approach in the code which uses shifts and a multiply.

Finally, the AVX versions are coded explicitly with AVX intrinsics, there is no reliance on the vageries of compiler 
vectorization.  The SIMD version could be written such that gcc *should* unroll loops and vectorize but others have
reported that it is necessary to tweak optimization flags to get the unrolling to work.  For these implementations,
all that is needed is to have the -mavx2 compiler option and the __AVX2_AVAILABLE__ symbol defined. 

# Usage

The class Xoshiro256Plus is a template class and takes an SIMDInstructionSet enumerated value as its only
template parameter.  SIMDInstructionSet may be 'NONE', 'AVX' or 'AVX2'.  The SIMD acceleration requires the AVX2
instruction set and uses 'if contexpr' to control code generation at compile time.  There is also a preprocessor
symbol __AVX2_AVAILABLE__ which must be defined to permit AVX2 instances of the RNG to be created.  It it completely
reasonable to have the AVX2 instruction set available but still use an RNG instance with no SIMD acceleration.

    #define __AVX2_AVAILABLE__

    #include "Xoshiro256Plus.h"

    constexpr size_t NUM_SAMPLES = 1000;
    constexpr uint64_t SEED = 1;

    typedef SEFUtility::RNG::Xoshiro256Plus<SIMDInstructionSet::NONE> Xoshiro256PlusSerial;
    typedef SEFUtility::RNG::Xoshiro256Plus<SIMDInstructionSet::AVX2> Xoshiro256PlusAVX2;

    bool    InsureFourWideRandomStreamsMatch()
    {
        Xoshiro256PlusSerial serial_rng(SEED);
        Xoshiro256PlusAVX2 avx_rng(SEED);

        for (auto i = 0; i < NUM_SAMPLES; i++)
        {
            auto next_four_serial = serial_rng.next4( 200, 300 );
            auto next_four_avx = avx_rng.next4( 200, 300 );

            if(( next_four_serial[0] != next_four_avx[0] ) ||
               ( next_four_serial[1] != next_four_avx[1] ) ||
               ( next_four_serial[2] != next_four_avx[2] ) ||
               ( next_four_serial[3] != next_four_avx[3] ))
            {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

As can be seen in the above example, four wide random values are created by both a fully serial instance
as well as by an AVX2 SIMD instance.

# Benchmarks

The AVX2 flavor of the RNG is clearly faster than the serial version - but only if you need 3 or more random values
at the same time.  For a single stream of random values, the AVX2 flavor of the generator is slower.  A full combination of benchmarks appears below.

The benchmarks generate the same total number of random values.  For example, the serial benchmark
creates 1,000,000 values and the four wide calls create 250,000 four wide results for the same total number of values.  The first benchmark is a 'reference' which uses the C implementation by Blackman and Vigna.  As can be seen, there is no penalty for using the C++ class - the timing compared to the reference is virtually identical.

Generating four wide results using the serial generator is not 4x the time of generating serial values, likely due to the CPU
being able to keep the RNG state in high speed cache or perhaps a register the whole time.  The AVX accelerated four wide
performance is roughly 2x that of the four wide serial implementation.  This matches fairly well with results from others.

The benchmarks include timing for unbounded uint64s, bounded uint64s, unbounded doubles and bounded doubles.  In general,
the unbounded uint64 performance is best and the other permutations share similar performance.

There also exist benchmarks where the values are generated and discarded, the values are summed using a single
variable or values are summed into __m256i packed integer or __m256d packed double variables using AVX SIMD instructions.  In general, the sums using the AVX SIMD instructions are faster than the same using a single variable (which ought to be the case).

A final note on performance - do not expect big performance boosts **unless** your code uses the AVX2 implementation and then
continues to work with the returned values using additional AVX instructions.  Any performance gain accrued by using the
AVX2 SIMD accelerated RNG is lost if the four wide values are then extracted individually and used one by one.

The following benchmarks were generated on 2 core Ubunutu 20.04 VM running on a Ryzen 7 1700 HW platform.  I expect the results
will generally be the same on other AMD Zen platforms and I expect the relative performance of the different permutations to
be generally the same on recent Intel CPUs but..... YMMV.  The only way to know for sure if your code will benefit from the SIMD
implementation is to benchmark it on your target platform(s).

Times are for generating 1,000,000 values.  For the reference benchmark and the first serial unbounded uint64 benchmark,
a little more than 1ms was required to generate the 1M values, therefore the RNG is able to generarte a new value in about 1ns
on the target system.  By comparison, the AVX2 implementation was able to generate 250k four wide values in 526 microseconds, which is about half a nanosecond per value.

# Perfomance without AVX2 at all

A final set of benchmarks below were generated for a subset of tests with the -mavx2 compiler flag not supplied.

This models a platform without the AVX2 instruction set at all and eliminates a variety of optimizations
the compiler *can* apply to the serial RNG code - even without a fully SIMD RNG implementation.  Essentially,
even on the same platform, the compiler can accelerate the serial code using AVX/AVX2 instructions even if
the RNG instance is not using the AVX2 intrinsics explicitly.

As can be seen, the reference and serial timing is the same - it has no dependency on the availability of AVX2 
instructions.   The biggest difference is seen with the double benchmark - it is considerably slower than the serial
implementation.  It is possible that could be addressed with a bit more careful coding but if you are planning on doing
anything that requires high performance numerical processing and you need a high-speed stream of random values - 
you ought to be running on a processer with AVX2, pretty much any decent processor made in the last 5 years supports it.

# Conclusion

All of the source code, unit tests and benchmarks are available in the repository.  Including the SIMD RNG into 
your project does not guarantee a dramatic performance improvement or even a measurable performance improvement.  
The Xoshiro256+ RNG is so fast that if you are using it already, the rest of your code is likely going 
to be consuming the overwhelming bulk of the CPU cycles.  Moving to the SIMD version will not net you much if the 
rest of your code drawing the random values is not AVX2 friendly already.  If however, you are using a slow RNG 
then using this code and shifting to the Xoshiro256+ RNG may be noticeable and it is possible that the compiler
may be able to better vectorize your code and take advantage of the SIMD RNG for further performance boosts.
